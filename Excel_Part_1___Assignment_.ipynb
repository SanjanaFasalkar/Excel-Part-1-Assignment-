        "-  Answer:\n",
        "Paste: This option simply pastes everything (values, formulas, formatting, etc.) from the copied cell(s) into the target cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If you copy a cell containing =A1+B1 with bold formatting and paste it, both the formula and bold formatting will be pasted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Paste Special: This gives you more control over what to paste. You can choose to paste only values, formulas, formats, or perform operations (like add, subtract, multiply).\n",

        "\n",
        "Split Panes: Divides the worksheet into two or four independent scrolling areas.\n",

        "Usefulness: Allows you to view and compare different parts of a large sheet at the same time.\n",

        "-  Answer:Purpose of XLOOKUP:\n",
        "XLOOKUP is a modern lookup function in Excel that searches a range or array, finds a match, and returns the corresponding value. It is more powerful and flexible than VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP.\n",

        "\n",
        "Column Index Issue:\n",
        "\n",
        "VLOOKUP requires a column index number (e.g., 2, 3). If columns are rearranged, the formula may break.\n",
        "\n",
        "XLOOKUP directly references the return column, so it is not affected by column order.\n",

        "\n",
        "Search from End:\n",
        "\n",
        "XLOOKUP can search from the top or bottom of a range. VLOOKUP can only search from the top.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "XLOOKUP allows a built-in \"if not found\" message.\n",
        "Example: =XLOOKUP(\"John\", A2:A10, B2:B10, \"Not Found\").\n",
        "\n",
